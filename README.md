# SimpleUi

A small plugin for Ash Framework (using Spark DSL) to define standard Airtable-like views for Ash Resources which should enable generation of no-code UI and basic apps.

See [test/simple_ui_test.exs](test/simple_ui_test.exs) for example usage.

This is experimental and not yet published on Hex. Please install from github.
